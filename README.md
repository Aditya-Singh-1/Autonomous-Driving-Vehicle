# Autonomous-Driving-Vehicle
In recent years, self-driving cars also known as an autonomous vehicle has the potential to revolutionize urban mobility by providing sustainable, safe, convenient, and congestion free transportability. It is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. This vehicle autonomy as an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has several challenges like infallibly recognizing traffic lights, signs, unclear lane markings, pedestrians, etc. The objective of this project is to simulate a self-driving car in autonomous mode; the project consist of lane detection, traffic sign classification, traffic light classification, vehicle and pedestrian detection with the help of computer vision and deep learning technology.
